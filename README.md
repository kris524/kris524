### Hi there 👋

I am Kristiyan. Software Engineer at [Arm](https://www.arm.com/), previously worked at [Agile Analog](https://www.agileanalog.com/), and [Cambridge Quantum](https://cambridgequantum.com/) 

☁️ I am interested in Semiconductors, Data/Software Infrastructure and Tooling.

📖 I always follow SOLID and Clean Code principles when writing code.

🛠️ I am language agnostic. I like contributing to open-source, experimenting, building, and participating in hackathons.

👾 I share what I read every week on my [newsletter](https://krisdilov.substack.com/)
